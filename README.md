This is a simple chat application built using Laravel 11 and the Laravel Reverb package. The application allows real-time messaging between users, powered by WebSockets.

## Features

- **Real-time messaging**: Chat messages are updated in real-time without the need to refresh the page.
- **User Authentication**: Built-in user authentication using Laravel’s default authentication system.
- **WebSocket Communication**: Powered by the Laravel Reverb package, allowing seamless WebSocket integration.
